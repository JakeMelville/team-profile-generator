## Description
This Application is designed to create an HTML document using the node.js terminal. The user will be prompted a series of questions. First, you will have to create the team manager.

## Requirements
For this application you will need to download npm, inquirer, and jest in the integrated terminal. 

## Technology Used
This application runs in the integrated node terminal, but Javascript was used to create this application and the final HTML.
